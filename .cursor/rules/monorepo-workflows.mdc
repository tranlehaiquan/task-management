# Monorepo Workflows

- **Workspace**: Managed by [pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml).
- **Tasks**: Orchestrated by [turbo.json](mdc:turbo.json).

Conventions:

- Install dependencies at the root; prefer filtered commands per app/package.
- Build and test tasks should run via Turborepo pipelines.
- Keep package boundaries clean; share code via `packages/*` with clear entry points.
