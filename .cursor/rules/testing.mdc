# Testing Conventions

- Each app includes Jest e2e scaffolding under `test/` (e.g., [apps/api-gateway/test/jest-e2e.json](mdc:apps/api-gateway/test/jest-e2e.json)).
- Tests should spin up a Nest application instance using the app's `AppModule` when doing e2e.
- Keep tests isolated and deterministic; clean up resources after runs.
- Organize tests mirroring feature structure for clarity.
